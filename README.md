Whistle
=======

Whistle is a web-based radio station for the Pi. You can choose the songs you wanna listen to from a bunch of stations. Written in Node.js
And oh, yes, its inspired by omxradio and it uses [omxcontrol](https://github.com/rikkertkoppes/omxcontrol), a little node wrapper
for the Omxplayer on the Raspberry Pi.
